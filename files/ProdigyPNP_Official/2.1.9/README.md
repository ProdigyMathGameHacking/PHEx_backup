# PHEx 2.1.7 Official

## Fixed Issues
- Fixed in 2.1.5: redirectorDomain was changed to `prodigyhacking.com` because `prodigyhacking.ml` was no longer owned by PMGH, and was changed to `prodigyhacking.com`.
- Fixed in 2.1.8: Content script was changed to work on `math.prodigygame.com` instead of `play.prodigygame.com`, because Prodigy changed their subdomain.
- Fixed in ProdigyPNP 2.1.8: redirectorDomain was changed to `p-np.prodigypnp.repl.co` because `prodigyhacking.com` was no longer being hosted due to DMCA issues.
- Fixed in ProdigyPNP 2.1.9: Version was changed to 2.1.9 to make sure that everyone updates to ProdigyPNP's working extension.

## Known Issues
- Currently, none.
